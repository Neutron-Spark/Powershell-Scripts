## Purpose
Backs up folders to another location, remote or local. Contains an almost unnecessary amount of checks to help figure out why the job failed. Designed to be used via a Scheduled task.

Edit the script with the relevant folder locations then simply run the script with the relevant user who has access to both source and destination areas.

Massively over-engineered script.
